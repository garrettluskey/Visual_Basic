Installation
step 1. double click setup
step 2. If setup fails to complete, run "SQLSysClrTypes", then run setup again
Installation requires a lot of accepting terms and clicking yes a lot, something I can avoid

After intallation the program should be running
Use the "Add new entry" button to begin entering data
Use the "Edit Existing" button to edit and view existing data(I included a few examples)
After closing the program for the first time you can run it again by clicking "Animal Registry_GLuskey" or "DesktopApplicationProgramming,WI,GarrettLuskey,RiponHighSchool"

Hope you enjoy :)
